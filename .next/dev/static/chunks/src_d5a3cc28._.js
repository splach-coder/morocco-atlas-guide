            "description": `Why book this trek?
- Trekking in the High Atlas Mountains
- See Berber villages
- Beautiful scenery
- See the waterfall in Setti Fatma

Tour Details:
In the higher elevations you’ll find mostly evergreen alpines with some occasional undergrowth, while the lower elevations have diverse valleys of walnut, apple, cherry and other fruit trees as well as mountain orchids, poppies and irises.

Trek Grades:
- Grade 1 walks (Easy): Tend to be short day walks and rambles at low altitudes. Grade 1 walks can be enjoyed by anyone who leads a reasonably active life and no special preparation is required.
- Grade 2 walks (Moderate): Will usually involve some longer walks (4-6 hours/day) at low altitudes (below 3000m). Some previous hill walking experience would be beneficial but these walks should be within the capabilities of those who lead a normal active life. Grade 2 walking tours may contain some optional strenuous days, and in order to get the best out of the trip we would advise that you tone up your fitness before you join.
- Grade 3 walks (Strenuous): Are for the more serious hill walker and a higher level of physical fitness is required. Walking days are normally 6-8 hours and may involve up to 900m or more of ascent and descent. You should be prepared for several consecutive days walking, often at higher altitudes, so stamina is important.

What to Bring:
For Atlas Trekking you need to prepare as you would for walking in any mountain region; it can be warm and sunny during the day but the weather in the mountains can quickly change from sunshine to snow and cold winds (autumn through late spring). Please do not leave any rubbish behind you; carry out what you carry in.
Atlas Treks are tailored to match the season and your level of fitness. You have the choice of basing yourself in Berber Guesthouses, from where you can take daily walks, or you can Atlas Mule Trek for 2+ days. On mule treks you usually have the choice of staying in Berber Guesthouse/with families or wild camping in 2-person tents. In addition to regular packing, here is a Check List for Atlas Trekking:
- Good walking boots and socks
- Comfortable shoes/slippers for camp/guesthouse
- Trekking pants
- Lightweight waterproof over-trousers / rain-pants`,

Nuestro trek comienza con un sendero que serpentea pasando por los pintorescos pueblos de Imlil, Arghen y M'zzik. Cada asentamiento ofrece un vistazo a la rica cultura bereber, con su arquitectura única y acogedores habitantes.

A medida que avanzamos, el paisaje se transforma en el impresionante Valle Assif Aït Mizane. Aquí, maravíllate con los antiguos campos de terrazas irrigadas, meticulosamente elaborados para sustentar una abundancia de árboles frutales y vegetales vibrantes. Un verdadero testimonio de la ingeniosidad humana y la armonía con la naturaleza.

Nuestro descenso nos lleva a través de un fragante bosque de enebros, finalmente conduciéndonos al encantador pueblo de Tizi Oussem. Aquí, descansaremos nuestras piernas cansadas y nos sumergiremos en la cálida hospitalidad de una casa de campo tradicional para pasar la noche.`,

- Senderismo en las montañas del Alto Atlas
- Ver pueblos bereberes
- Hermosos paisajes
- Ver la cascada en Setti Fatma

Detalles del Tour:
En las elevaciones más altas encontrarás principalmente alpinas perennes con alguna vegetación ocasional, mientras que las elevaciones más bajas tienen diversos valles de nogales, manzanos, cerezos y otros árboles frutales, así como orquídeas de montaña, amapolas e iris.

Grados de Trek:
- Caminatas Grado 1 (Fácil): Suelen ser caminatas cortas de un día y paseos a bajas altitudes. Las caminatas de Grado 1 pueden ser disfrutadas por cualquiera que lleve una vida razonablemente activa y no se requiere preparación especial.
- Caminatas Grado 2 (Moderado): Suelen implicar algunas caminatas más largas (4-6 horas/día) a bajas altitudes (por debajo de 3000m). Alguna experiencia previa de caminata en colinas sería beneficiosa pero estas caminatas deberían estar al alcance de quienes llevan una vida activa normal. Los tours de caminata de Grado 2 pueden contener algunos días opcionales extenuantes, y para aprovechar al máximo el viaje te aconsejaríamos que mejoraras tu forma física antes de unirte.
- Caminatas Grado 3 (Extenuante): Son para el excursionista de colinas más serio y se requiere un nivel más alto de forma física. Los días de caminata suelen ser de 6-8 horas y pueden implicar hasta 900m o más de ascenso y descenso. Deberías estar preparado para varios días consecutivos caminando, a menudo a mayores altitudes, por lo que la resistencia es importante.

Qué Traer:
Para el Trekking en el Atlas necesitas prepararte como lo harías para caminar en cualquier región montañosa; puede ser cálido y soleado durante el día pero el clima en las montañas puede cambiar rápidamente de sol a nieve y vientos fríos (otoño hasta finales de primavera). Por favor no dejes basura; lleva lo que traigas.
Los Treks del Atlas se adaptan a la temporada y tu nivel de forma física. Tienes la opción de establecerte en Casas de Huéspedes Bereberes, desde donde puedes hacer caminatas diarias, o puedes hacer un Trek de Mulas del Atlas de 2+ días. En los treks de mulas generalmente tienes la opción de alojarte en Casa de Huéspedes Bereber/con familias o acampar en tiendas de 2 personas. Además del equipaje regular, aquí tienes una Lista de Verificación para el Trekking en el Atlas:
- Buenas botas de senderismo y calcetines
- Zapatos cómodos/zapatillas para campamento/casa de huéspedes
- Pantalones de trekking

Nuestro trek comienza con un sendero que serpentea pasando por los pintorescos pueblos de Imlil, Arghen y M'zzik. Cada asentamiento ofrece un vistazo a la rica cultura bereber, con su arquitectura única y acogedores habitantes.

A medida que avanzamos, el paisaje se transforma en el impresionante Valle Assif Aït Mizane. Aquí, maravíllate con los antiguos campos de terrazas irrigadas, meticulosamente elaborados para sustentar una abundancia de árboles frutales y vegetales vibrantes. Un verdadero testimonio de la ingeniosidad humana y la armonía con la naturaleza.

Conquistar el paso de montaña Tiz M'zzik (2450m) será un desafío gratificante, ofreciendo vistas panorámicas que te dejarán sin aliento. Respira el aire fresco de la montaña mientras disfrutas del impresionante paisaje.

Nuestro descenso nos lleva a través de un fragante bosque de enebros, finalmente conduciéndonos al encantador pueblo de Tizi Oussem. Aquí, descansaremos nuestras piernas cansadas y nos sumergiremos en la cálida hospitalidad de una casa de campo tradicional para pasar la noche.`,

- Senderismo en las montañas del Alto Atlas
- Ver pueblos bereberes
- Hermosos paisajes
- Ver la cascada en Setti Fatma

Detalles del Tour:
En las elevaciones más altas encontrarás principalmente alpinas perennes con alguna vegetación ocasional, mientras que las elevaciones más bajas tienen diversos valles de nogales, manzanos, cerezos y otros árboles frutales, así como orquídeas de montaña, amapolas e iris.

Grados de Trek:
- Caminatas Grado 1 (Fácil): Suelen ser caminatas cortas de un día y paseos a bajas altitudes. Las caminatas de Grado 1 pueden ser disfrutadas por cualquiera que lleve una vida razonablemente activa y no se requiere preparación especial.
- Caminatas Grado 2 (Moderado): Suelen implicar algunas caminatas más largas (4-6 horas/día) a bajas altitudes (por debajo de 3000m). Alguna experiencia previa de caminata en colinas sería beneficiosa pero estas caminatas deberían estar al alcance de quienes llevan una vida activa normal. Los tours de caminata de Grado 2 pueden contener algunos días opcionales extenuantes, y para aprovechar al máximo el viaje te aconsejaríamos que mejoraras tu forma física antes de unirte.
- Caminatas Grado 3 (Extenuante): Son para el excursionista de colinas más serio y se requiere un nivel más alto de forma física. Los días de caminata suelen ser de 6-8 horas y pueden implicar hasta 900m o más de ascenso y descenso. Deberías estar preparado para varios días consecutivos caminando, a menudo a mayores altitudes, por lo que la resistencia es importante.

Qué Traer:
Para el Trekking en el Atlas necesitas prepararte como lo harías para caminar en cualquier región montañosa; puede ser cálido y soleado durante el día pero el clima en las montañas puede cambiar rápidamente de sol a nieve y vientos fríos (otoño hasta finales de primavera). Por favor no dejes basura; lleva lo que traigas.
Los Treks del Atlas se adaptan a la temporada y tu nivel de forma física. Tienes la opción de establecerte en Casas de Huéspedes Bereberes, desde donde puedes hacer caminatas diarias, o puedes hacer un Trek de Mulas del Atlas de 2+ días. En los treks de mulas generalmente tienes la opción de alojarte en Casa de Huéspedes Bereber/con familias o acampar en tiendas de 2 personas. Además del equipaje regular, aquí tienes una Lista de Verificación para el Trekking en el Atlas:
- Buenas botas de senderismo y calcetines
- Zapatos cómodos/zapatillas para campamento/casa de huéspedes
- Pantalones de trekking
- Pantalones impermeables ligeros/pantalones de lluvia`,
