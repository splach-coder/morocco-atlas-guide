            "description": `Why book this trek?
- Trekking in the High Atlas Mountains
- See Berber villages
- Beautiful scenery
- See the waterfall in Setti Fatma

Tour Details:
In the higher elevations you’ll find mostly evergreen alpines with some occasional undergrowth, while the lower elevations have diverse valleys of walnut, apple, cherry and other fruit trees as well as mountain orchids, poppies and irises.

Trek Grades:
- Grade 1 walks (Easy): Tend to be short day walks and rambles at low altitudes. Grade 1 walks can be enjoyed by anyone who leads a reasonably active life and no special preparation is required.
- Grade 2 walks (Moderate): Will usually involve some longer walks (4-6 hours/day) at low altitudes (below 3000m). Some previous hill walking experience would be beneficial but these walks should be within the capabilities of those who lead a normal active life. Grade 2 walking tours may contain some optional strenuous days, and in order to get the best out of the trip we would advise that you tone up your fitness before you join.
- Grade 3 walks (Strenuous): Are for the more serious hill walker and a higher level of physical fitness is required. Walking days are normally 6-8 hours and may involve up to 900m or more of ascent and descent. You should be prepared for several consecutive days walking, often at higher altitudes, so stamina is important.

What to Bring:
For Atlas Trekking you need to prepare as you would for walking in any mountain region; it can be warm and sunny during the day but the weather in the mountains can quickly change from sunshine to snow and cold winds (autumn through late spring). Please do not leave any rubbish behind you; carry out what you carry in.
Atlas Treks are tailored to match the season and your level of fitness. You have the choice of basing yourself in Berber Guesthouses, from where you can take daily walks, or you can Atlas Mule Trek for 2+ days. On mule treks you usually have the choice of staying in Berber Guesthouse/with families or wild camping in 2-person tents. In addition to regular packing, here is a Check List for Atlas Trekking:
- Good walking boots and socks
- Comfortable shoes/slippers for camp/guesthouse
- Trekking pants
- Lightweight waterproof over-trousers / rain-pants`,
